`Search what you want, receive what you need`

This project began as a business idea so that people could find products and/or services that other people could provide. This is done through a search system that users can send to the server and it would notify all users within said category.

The mobile application is developed in react-native and the server in node and express. For the database I used mongoDB through the mongoose ODM.

This application was initially oriented towards a few essential functionalities for the MVP and later, I ended up developing more flows to allow users to have immersive experiences in the application.

I decided to make this project public because I tried to get investors and was not successful. Therefore I made the decision to make it public for portfolio purposes. It took me 6 months to develop this application.

I hope this project can serve to show part of my current skills in software development. Although it should be noted that I have decided not to make any more updates; This means that depending on when you see this code, it may already be somewhat obsolete to the way I write code by now, because I always try to continue improving my skills.

Thanks for watching.
